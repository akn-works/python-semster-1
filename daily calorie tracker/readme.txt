assignment 1 
The Daily Calorie Tracker App is a beginner-friendly Python program that helps users log their meals and track their total daily calorie intake. It allows users to enter the names of meals they’ve eaten, record calorie values for each meal, calculate the total and average calories, and compare the result with a self-set daily calorie limit.

At the end, the program neatly displays a summary table showing each meal and its calories, along with totals and averages. It also includes an optional feature to save the entire session report (with date and time) into a .txt file for later reference.

This project demonstrates the use of Python basics such as:

Input and output (input(), print())

Lists for data storage

Loops (for loop)

Conditional statements (if...else)

Basic arithmetic calculations

File handling (open(), write())

String formatting with f-strings
